# Airbnb Clone

Imagine an Airbnb-like website where you can effortlessly control and debug data behind the scenes, just like you would with a command prompt. This makes it a breeze for developers to manage the website's inner workings. The user-facing website is a blend of pre-built elements and dynamic features that cater to the users' needs. It's like having a beautiful home with custom touches. All the data is securely stored in a trusty database or file storage system. Each piece of information is treated with the utmost care, like precious objects in a vault. To connect the user interface with the data storage, we have a super-smart API. It's like a bridge that allows the website and the data to talk to each other, making everything work smoothly.

## Features

- ### **Command Interpreter (Console)**: 
    A powerful tool that allows you to manage (create, update, destroy, etc.) objects via a console/command interpreter.

   - To run the console, follow these steps:

        1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

        2. Navigate to the project directory:
            ```
            cd /path/to/your/project
            ```

        3. Start the console:
            ```
            python3 console.py
            ```

        4. You will see a prompt indicating that the console is running. From here, you can enter commands to manage objects in the system.
            ```
            (hbnb) 
            ```
    - To check the available commands, you can run `help` in the console. This will display a list of commands and their descriptions.
    ```
    (hbnb) help
    ```

That's it! You have successfully started the command interpreter (console) for the project.

- **Data Model**: Define your data model and let the system handle the storage and persistence.

- **Storage Engine**: The storage engine provides an abstraction between your objects and how they are stored and persisted. This allows you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

- **API**: The API provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data, allowing you to retrieve, create, delete, and update them.

- **Website (Front-end)**: A static and dynamic website that showcases the final product to users.

- **Data Persistence**: The system can store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).
